        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="para"><span>Small and quaint, jiki was created by Akemi &amp; Ena Nakaya,</span> first started out as a seed in the wind; just a passing thought. Jiki means season in Japanese, we want this to be a place where you can go in any season– Summer, Winter, Autumn &amp; Spring– but also whether you're in a season of loneliness, joy, growth or feeling stuck.</p>
        <p class="para2">Akemi had always wished she had physical space to go to during all the times she needed to escape the rhythms of life. When this thought came to her, she brushed it off as a wild dream; she couldn't leave the corporate world for an uncertain future. However, when she mentioned it to Ena, he pushed her to make it a reality.</p>
        <p class="para3">Akemi was working as an accountant in the San Francisco, and had worked all her life to get to where she was. Akemi wanted to provide something for others she could never have dreamed of having through all her struggles and dark moments.We want to be that place for you to come as you are. Through any season. Thank you for sharing your moments with us!</p>
        <h2>Sourcing</h2>
        <p class="para4">We do our best to source our ingredients ethically and as locally as possible! If you have any resources or suggestions of organizations we can partner with we’d be happy to hear from you! It’s important to us to make tasty drinks and treats, but we also want to preserve our home.</p>
