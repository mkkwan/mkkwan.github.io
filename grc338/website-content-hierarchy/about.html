        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>Small and quaint, jiki was created by Akemi &amp; Ena Nakaya, first started out as a seed in the wind; just a passing thought. </p>
        <p>Akemi had always wished she had physical space to go to during all the times she needed to escape the rhythms of life. When this thought came to her, she brushed it off as a wild dream; she couldn't leave the corporate world for an uncertain future. However, when she mentioned it to Ena, he pushed her to make it a reality. Akemi was working as an accountant in the San Francisco, and had worked all her life to get to where she was. Akemi wanted to provide something for others she could never have dreamed of having through all her struggles and dark moments.</p>
